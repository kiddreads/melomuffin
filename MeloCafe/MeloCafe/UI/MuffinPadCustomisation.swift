//  MuffinPadCustomisation.swift
//  Muffin - movable/resizable button groups, colour presets, and the two file formats.
//
//  Wired into the preview showcase build (branch preview/showcase-sneak-peek). Lives under docs/ next to GamePadGeometry.swift, which it needs.
//
//  Three things live here:
//
//  1. `PadGroup` - the nine things a user can pick up and move. The shipping
//     `ControllerCustomLayout` already stores {dx, dy, scale} per element and already
//     groups L+ZL and R+ZR; this is the same idea at the grain Brandon asked for, so the
//     storage does not change, only `groupID(for:)` gets coarser.
//
//  2. `.muffinlyt` and `.muffinclr` - a layout and a colour scheme as files, so either can
//     be shared, versioned or shipped as a preset.
//
//  3. `PadPresetFitter` - what happens when a layout authored on one device is opened on
//     another. It fits, and then fixes ONLY what is actually broken.
//

//  GamePadGeometry.swift
//  Muffin - the on-screen pad, taken from the Wii U GamePad hardware.
//
//  Wired into the preview showcase build (branch preview/showcase-sneak-peek). `src/ios/project.yml` pulls `src/ios/App` in as a group, so
//  every .swift in that folder compiles; this file lives under docs/ so it cannot break
//  a build before anyone has read it. Moving it into `src/ios/App/` is the whole of
//  "wiring it in" - see WIRING at the bottom.
//
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Where the numbers come from
//
//  The shipping `ControllerGeometry` is measured from IMG_3278.jpeg, a screenshot of an
//  on-screen pad. This one is measured from the GamePad itself: the official Wii U
//  controller illustration, at 0.425 mm per pixel. That scale is not assumed, it is
//  checked twice against the real hardware and agrees both times:
//
//      600 px body  x 0.425 = 255.0 mm   (Nintendo: 255 mm)
//      314 px body  x 0.425 = 133.5 mm   (Nintendo: 134 mm)
//      324 x 185 px screen  = 137.7 x 78.6 mm -> 158 mm diagonal (Nintendo: 6.2 in)
//
//  So every constant below is a real hardware dimension, and "life-size" is a claim
//  this file can actually make good on.
//
//  The unit is D, one face-button diameter = 10.625 mm, the same unit
//  `ControllerGeometry` already uses. Pleasingly, the body is exactly 24 D wide.
//
//  What is measured and what is not: everything on the front face is measured. The
//  shoulders are not - L/R/ZL/ZR are on the top edge and do not appear in a front view -
//  so their pill size is kept from the IMG_3278 measurement and their position is
//  placed, directly above their own stick, which is where they are on the hardware.
//  They are the only placed geometry here, and they are marked at their definition.

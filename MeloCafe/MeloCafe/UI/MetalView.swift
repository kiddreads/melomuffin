    // .layer a CAMetalLayer with its own active render loop. CreateMetalLayer()
    // (MetalLayer.mm) then added the REAL C++ renderer's CAMetalLayer as a SUBLAYER of
    // that already-active Metal-backed layer - two independent Metal render loops
    // fighting over one layer tree, one requesting drawables via MTKView's own
    // currentDrawable every frame, the other calling nextDrawable() directly on the
    // sublayer from the GPU thread. A live device test confirmed this is genuinely
    // unstable (crashes recurring in MetalRenderer::BeginFrame -> nextDrawable even
    // after fixing the separate view-retain issue) - a plain UIView's .layer is an
    // ordinary CALayer with no competing rendering machinery of its own, so the C++
    // sublayer has the view's layer tree to itself.

// MELOMUFFIN ADAPTATION NOTE: Muffin's original file continued with a macOS
// NSViewRepresentable path (guarded by `#if os(macOS)`) plus a `MetalRenderer`
// MTKViewDelegate class that - in the upstream file - sat OUTSIDE that `#if`, so it
// compiled unconditionally and called `gameManager.getFrameTexture()`, a method
// this port's GameManager.swift adapter does not have (MeloCafe's own bridge has no
// equivalent frame-texture query; MeloCafe's real Metal/Vulkan renderer draws
// directly into the CAMetalLayer via CemuUIKit_InitializeLayer, with no Swift-side
// texture hand-off at all). melomuffin is iOS-only (this is MeloCafe's own
// iOS-only Xcode project), so that whole macOS path is dead code here; it is
// dropped rather than carried over unused and non-compiling. See cemu-ios-muffin's
// own src/ios/App/MetalView.swift for the original if a macOS target is ever added.

/// and could not be moved or resized. It now draws the arrangement in
/// `ControllerGeometry` - measured from the layout Brandon sent - by absolute position,
/// which is what lets one unit scale the whole thing and lets a cluster be dragged.
///
/// Still no backing plate and no divider, for the reason the old version documented: an
/// opaque slab had to sit in the layout flow and stole a strip of height from the
/// emulator view for the sole purpose of being grey. Every control here is positioned
/// over the game, and the space between the two clusters is not hit-tested at all, so
/// taps in the middle still reach the game view.

/// skin catalog is untouched; it is only the in-game pad that never painted them.

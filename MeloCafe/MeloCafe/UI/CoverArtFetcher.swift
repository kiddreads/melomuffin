//  Ported from cemu-ios-muffin unmodified, kept here for a future adaptation pass.
//  This file calls Muffin's own cemu_bridge_* functions (CemuBridge.h), which do
//  not exist on MeloCafe's bridge, and it is deliberately EXCLUDED from this
//  Xcode project's Compile Sources build phase (see project.pbxproj) rather than
//  left in with calls that would not link. See the repo README's "Known gaps"
//  section for what a real port of this file would need on MeloCafe's side.
